# ComfyUI Text Split Node Requirements
# Core dependencies for the custom node

# No external dependencies required for basic functionality
# The node uses only Python standard library modules:
# - re (for regex support) - available since Python 1.5
# - typing (for type hints) - available since Python 3.5

# Minimum Python version: 3.7
# This ensures compatibility with most ComfyUI installations
# while maintaining access to all required features

# If additional features are added later, add dependencies here with minimum versions:
# Example:
# requests>=2.25.1
# numpy>=1.21.0

# Note: All dependencies should specify minimum versions only
# to avoid conflicts with other custom nodes
