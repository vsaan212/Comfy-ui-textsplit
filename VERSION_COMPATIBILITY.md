# Version Compatibility Strategy

## Overview
This project has been designed with a **minimum version approach** to ensure maximum compatibility with other ComfyUI custom nodes while maintaining functionality.

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimum Version Requirements Only
- **Python**: 3.7+ (minimum required for all features)
- **Dependencies**: None (uses only Python standard library)
- **Future dependencies**: Will specify minimum versions only (e.g., `requests>=2.25.1`)

### 2. Benefits of This Approach

#### ✅ Reduced Conflicts
- No version pinning means no conflicts with other nodes
- Other nodes can use newer versions of shared dependencies
- ComfyUI can update dependencies without breaking this node

#### ✅ Better Compatibility
- Works with any Python version 3.7 or higher
- Compatible with future Python releases
- No dependency version lock-in

#### ✅ Easier Maintenance
- Less dependency management overhead
- Fewer compatibility issues to resolve
- Simpler installation process

## Implementation Details

### Version Checking
```python
# Version compatibility check
MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = (3, 7)
if sys.version_info < MIN_PYTHON_VERSION:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Python {MIN_PYTHON_VERSION[0]}.{MIN_PYTHON_VERSION[1]} or higher is required")
```

### Type Hints
- Uses `Union` and `Tuple` for flexible return types
- Compatible with Python 3.7+ typing features
- No advanced typing features that require newer Python versions

### Installation Script
- Checks for minimum Python version (3.7)
- Validates version before proceeding
- Clear error messages for version issues

## Testing

### Version Compatibility Tests
- ✅ Python version validation
- ✅ Module availability checks
- ✅ Type hint compatibility
- ✅ Installation script validation

### All Tests Pass
- ✅ Basic functionality
- ✅ Regex support
- ✅ Dynamic outputs
- ✅ Text processing
- ✅ Edge cases
- ✅ Version compatibility

## Future Considerations

### Adding Dependencies
When adding new dependencies in the future:

1. **Always use minimum versions**:
   ```
   requests>=2.25.1
   numpy>=1.21.0
   ```

2. **Never pin exact versions**:
   ```
   ❌ requests==2.25.1
   ❌ numpy==1.21.0
   ```

3. **Document minimum requirements**:
   - Update `tranlooprequirements.txt`
   - Update version compatibility tests
   - Update documentation

### Python Version Support
- Current minimum: Python 3.7
- Will support all future Python versions
- Will only increase minimum version if absolutely necessary

## Best Practices for Other Developers

### When Contributing
1. Use minimum version requirements
2. Test with multiple Python versions
3. Avoid version-specific features
4. Document any version dependencies

### When Installing
1. Run `install.bat` to check compatibility
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
3. No additional dependencies required

## Conclusion

This version compatibility strategy ensures that the Text Split node:
- ✅ Works with most ComfyUI installations
- ✅ Doesn't conflict with other custom nodes
- ✅ Is easy to install and maintain
- ✅ Will continue working with future updates

The approach prioritizes **compatibility over control**, making it a good citizen in the ComfyUI ecosystem.
